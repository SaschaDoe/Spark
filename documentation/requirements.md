# SPARK Soundtrack Requirements

## Project Overview
**SPARK** - Original Soundtrack for a Film That Was Never Made

A musical journey through a middle-grade fantasy adventure about two young heroes from enemy families who must work together to heal their dying sun and save their magical kingdom.

## Core Concept
This is a soundtrack album for an imaginary film based on the story of Finn and Nova - two teenagers with complementary magical abilities who discover that their "kingdom" is actually a generation ship, their "magic" is bioelectric technology, and their dying "sun" is a failing fusion reactor.

## Musical Requirements

### Album Structure
- **Target Length**: 45-60 minutes
- **Track Count**: 12-15 tracks following the three-act story structure
- **Format**: Digital album with potential for vinyl release

### Act-Based Composition

#### Act I: When The Lights Dim (Tracks 1-4)
- Opening theme introducing the magical kingdom
- The flickering sun motif (alternating between warm and cold tones)
- Finn and Nova's separate themes that clash then harmonize
- Lady Seraphina's deceptively beautiful but unsettling theme

#### Act II: The Underground Adventure (Tracks 5-9)
- Underground exploration themes with mysterious/adventurous tone
- Character themes for Luna, Zephyr, and Old Pete
- The magic train sequence - building momentum and romance
- Museum of memories - nostalgic and revelatory

#### Act III: Healing The Sun (Tracks 10-15)
- Battle music for the confrontation with Seraphina
- Sacrifice theme - bittersweet and heroic
- The healing/restoration sequence
- Epilogue - hopeful but changed, hints at the stars beyond

### Musical Style Guidelines
- **Genre Blend**: Orchestral fantasy with subtle electronic/synth elements (representing the hidden sci-fi nature)
- **Dual Nature**: Surface-level magical/whimsical themes with underlying technological pulses
- **Character Motifs**: 
  - Finn: Warm, solar-inspired melodies
  - Nova: Deep, rhythmic patterns
  - Together: Harmonizing creates "sparks" (musical crescendos)
- **Hidden Layer**: Adults should notice sci-fi elements in the production that kids might miss

### Emotional Arc
1. Wonder and mystery
2. Growing tension and unease
3. Friendship and discovery
4. Romance and unity
5. Danger and confrontation
6. Sacrifice and loss
7. Healing and hope
8. New beginnings with earned wisdom

## Technical Requirements

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Fans of film soundtracks and fantasy music

## Thematic Requirements

### Core Themes to Emphasize
- Unity despite differences
- The cost of heroism
- Technology vs. magic duality
- Generational journey and hope
- Fear of mortality (Seraphina/AI subplot)

### Consequences in Music
The music should reflect that victories come with costs:
- Finn & Nova's theme becomes quieter/simpler after their sacrifice
- Battle music includes tragic undertones
- Victory themes are bittersweet, not purely triumphant

## Visual Components

### Album Art Requirements
- Dual imagery: magical kingdom surface / spaceship depths
- Sun/fusion reactor as central image
- Finn and Nova silhouettes with complementary energy
- Hidden sci-fi elements for careful observers

### Track Visualizers
- Abstract representations of each scene
- Color coding: warm (Finn), cool (Nova), gold (Seraphina)
- Particle effects suggesting both magic and technology

## Release Strategy

### Phase 1: Singles
- Release 3-4 key tracks as singles with story context
- "When Sparks Fly" (Finn & Nova's meeting)
- "The Dying Sun" (main theme)
- "Seraphina's Waltz" (villain theme)

### Phase 2: Full Album
- Complete soundtrack with comprehensive liner notes
- Digital booklet with story synopsis
- Commissioned artwork for each track

### Phase 3: Extended Universe
- Remix versions of select tracks
- Character theme variations
- Live performance possibilities

## Success Metrics
- Streaming numbers across platforms
- Patreon subscriber growth
- Sync licensing inquiries
- Community engagement and fan art
- Potential for actual film/series adaptation interest

## Additional Notes
- The soundtrack should work both as background music and standalone listening
- Each track title should hint at the story without requiring prior knowledge
- Consider accessibility with detailed track descriptions for visually impaired listeners
- Environmental themes subtle but present (dying sun = climate metaphor)
