# SPARK Soundtrack Requirements

## Project Overview
**SPARK** - AI-Generated Soundtrack for a Film That Was Never Made

A musical journey through a middle-grade fantasy adventure about two young heroes from rival clans who must unite their opposing powers to restore the failing light that sustains their mysterious realm.

Created using [Suno AI](https://suno.com) to bring this imaginary film score to life through artificial intelligence.

## Core Concept
This is a soundtrack album for an imaginary film based on the story of Finn and Nova - two teenagers with complementary abilities who must overcome ancient rivalries to heal the dying light at the heart of their world. What begins as a magical adventure gradually reveals deeper mysteries about the true nature of their realm.

## Musical Requirements

### Album Structure
- **Target Length**: 45-60 minutes
- **Track Count**: 12-15 tracks following the three-act story structure
- **Format**: Digital album with potential for vinyl release

### Act-Based Composition

#### Act I: When The Lights Dim (Tracks 1-4)
- Opening theme introducing the magical kingdom
- The flickering sun motif (alternating between warm and cold tones)
- Finn and Nova's separate themes that clash then harmonize
- Lady Seraphina's deceptively beautiful but unsettling theme

#### Act II: The Underground Adventure (Tracks 5-9)
- Underground exploration themes with mysterious/adventurous tone
- Character themes for Luna, Zephyr, and Old Pete
- The magic train sequence - building momentum and romance
- Museum of memories - nostalgic and revelatory

#### Act III: Healing The Sun (Tracks 10-15)
- Battle music for the confrontation with Seraphina
- Sacrifice theme - bittersweet and heroic
- The healing/restoration sequence
- Epilogue - hopeful but changed, hints at the stars beyond

### Musical Style Guidelines
- **Genre Blend**: Orchestral fantasy with subtle electronic/synth elements (representing hidden mysteries)
- **Dual Nature**: Surface-level magical/whimsical themes with underlying enigmatic pulses
- **Character Motifs**: 
  - Finn: Warm, solar-inspired melodies
  - Nova: Deep, rhythmic patterns
  - Together: Harmonizing creates "sparks" (musical crescendos)
- **Hidden Layer**: Adults should notice subtle technological elements that hint at deeper mysteries

### Emotional Arc

2. Growing tension and unease
3. Friendship and discovery
4. Romance and unity

## Thematic Requirements

### Core Themes to Emphasize
- Unity despite differences
- The cost of heroism
- Ancient mysteries vs. surface magic
- Journey toward understanding and hope
- Fear of mortality (Seraphina's desperate subplot)

### Consequences in Music
The music should reflect that victories come with costs:
- Finn & Nova's theme becomes quieter/simpler after their sacrifice
- Battle music includes tragic undertones
- Victory themes are bittersweet, not purely triumphant

## Visual Components

### Album Art Requirements
- Dual imagery: mystical realm surface with hints of deeper mysteries below
- Dying sun/ancient light source as central image
- Finn and Nova silhouettes with complementary energy
- Hidden technological elements for careful observers

### Track Visualizers
- Abstract representations of each scene
- Color coding: warm (Finn), cool (Nova), gold (Seraphina)
- Particle effects suggesting both magic and hidden mysteries

## Release Strategy

### Phase 1: Singles
- Release 3-4 key tracks as singles with story context
- "When Sparks Fly" (Finn & Nova's meeting)
- "The Dying Sun" (main theme)
- "Seraphina's Waltz" (villain theme)

### Phase 2: Full Album
- Complete soundtrack with comprehensive liner notes
- Digital booklet with story synopsis
- Commissioned artwork for each track

### Phase 3: Extended Universe
- Remix versions of select tracks
- Character theme variations
- Live performance possibilities

## Success Metrics
- Streaming numbers across platforms
- Patreon subscriber growth
- Sync licensing inquiries
- Community engagement and fan art
- Potential for actual film/series adaptation interest

## Additional Notes
- The soundtrack should work both as background music and standalone listening
- Each track title should hint at the story without requiring prior knowledge
- Consider accessibility with detailed track descriptions for visually impaired listeners
- Environmental themes subtle but present (dying sun = climate metaphor)
